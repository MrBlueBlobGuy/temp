<h2 id="-abstract-"><strong>Abstract</strong></h2>
<p>Wireless power transfer (WPT) enables electric vehicles (EVs) to charge without physical connectors by transferring energy through resonant magnetic coupling. Among various global initiatives, the On-Line Electric Vehicle (OLEV) project at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) represents the most complete real-world demonstration of dynamic wireless charging. This paper summarizes the fundamentals of WPT for EVs, outlines the OLEV system design, and analyzes its technical, economic, and safety performance using findings from Li and Mi (2015). The case illustrates that dynamic WPT can overcome range anxiety and transform EV infrastructure.</p>

<h2 id="-i-introduction-"><strong>I. Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Electrification of transportation is driven by environmental and energy security concerns. Yet plug-in EVs remain constrained by charging downtime, limited range, and user inconvenience. Wireless charging—first applied to small electronics—now scales to kilowatt levels, transferring energy efficiently across gaps exceeding 200 mm.</p>
<p>As reviewed by Li and Mi [1], wireless power transfer for EVs achieves grid-to-battery efficiencies above 90 % in stationary systems and 70–83 % in dynamic roadway installations. The KAIST OLEV project extends this technology from laboratory prototypes to public transit buses, establishing a foundation for continuous, contactless power delivery.</p>

<h2 id="-ii-principles-of-wireless-power-transfer-"><strong>II. Principles of Wireless Power Transfer</strong></h2>
<p>Wireless EV charging uses <strong>inductive coupling</strong> between a transmitting coil buried in the road or pad and a receiving coil under the vehicle. The alternating current in the primary coil creates an oscillating magnetic field that induces voltage in the secondary coil.</p>
<p>Li and Mi derived the power transfer relation:</p>
<p>P12​=ωMI<sub>1</sub>​I<sub>2</sub>​sin(ϕ12​)</p>
<p>where (M) is mutual inductance and (\phi_{12}) the phase angle. Maximum transfer occurs at a 90° phase difference. Efficiency depends on coupling coefficient (k) and coil quality factor (Q); typical EV values (k≈0.2, Q≈300) yield over 96 % theoretical efficiency [1].</p>
<p>Dynamic WPT extends this concept by distributing multiple primary coils along a track, sequentially energized as a vehicle moves above them.</p>

<h2 id="-iii-the-kaist-on-line-electric-vehicle-system-"><strong>III. The KAIST On-Line Electric Vehicle System</strong></h2>
<h3 id="-a-project-overview-"><strong>A. Project Overview</strong></h3>
<p>KAIST launched the OLEV program in 2009 to test <strong>dynamic wireless power transfer</strong> for public transportation. The aim was to eliminate dependence on large onboard batteries and demonstrate practical roadway electrification. The system was deployed on intra-campus and city bus routes in Daejeon, South Korea, with continuous operation beginning in 2013.</p>
<p>The infrastructure embeds segmented transmitting coils beneath the asphalt surface. Power electronics modules feed high-frequency current to the coils at 20–30 kHz. As vehicles pass, each segment is activated only under the vehicle to minimize stray field exposure.</p>
<h3 id="-b-system-architecture-"><strong>B. System Architecture</strong></h3>
<p>The OLEV configuration comprises:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Primary Track:</strong> Modular coils installed 20 cm below the road surface; each segment is 5–10 m long.</li>
<li><strong>Secondary Pickup Unit:</strong> A receiver coil, rectifier, and DC/DC converter mounted under the bus chassis.</li>
<li><strong>Power Supply Cabinet:</strong> Converts utility AC to high-frequency AC through full-bridge inverters and LCL compensation networks.</li>
<li><strong>Control and Communication Layer:</strong> Detects vehicle position, enables segment switching, and regulates power transfer.</li>
</ol>
<p>The OLEV adopts a <strong>bipolar I-type magnetic coupler</strong>, improving coupling efficiency and lateral alignment tolerance compared to earlier U- or W-shaped cores [1].</p>
<p>Figuratively, this design narrows the track width to 10 cm while sustaining a 200 mm air gap, reducing material cost and electromagnetic leakage.</p>
<h3 id="-c-operating-principle-"><strong>C. Operating Principle</strong></h3>
<p>When the bus travels along the road, the onboard coil passes sequentially over energized track segments. Each segment transfers up to 60 kW at 20–30 kHz. Power is rectified and delivered to a 70 kWh lithium-polymer battery, maintaining charge during motion.</p>
<p>Only 5–15 % of the roadway is energized at any instant. Energy management units synchronize switching between segments using wireless communication. Efficiency measurements reported by KAIST and cited in Li and Mi [1] show <strong>70 % for 60 kW buses</strong> and <strong>83 % for 20 kW SUVs</strong> at 160 mm vertical clearance and ±200 mm lateral tolerance.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-iv-magnetic-coupler-design-"><strong>IV. Magnetic Coupler Design</strong></h2>
<p>The I-type coupler consists of ferrite cores arranged in alternating poles beneath the road. This configuration decouples transfer distance from track width, allowing narrow coils with uniform flux density. The receiver coil mirrors this structure for optimal coupling.</p>
<p>Li and Mi emphasize that the coupling coefficient (k) and quality factor (Q) are key performance metrics. In OLEV, (k≈0.15–0.25) and operating frequency 20–30 kHz balance efficiency with manageable switching losses. Litz wire minimizes AC resistance, while ferrite slabs guide magnetic flux and suppress eddy currents in the vehicle chassis.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-v-power-electronics-and-control-"><strong>V. Power Electronics and Control</strong></h2>
<p>Each power supply module contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AC/DC rectifier</strong> with power-factor correction.</li>
<li><strong>Full-bridge resonant inverter</strong> generating high-frequency excitation.</li>
<li><strong>LCL compensation</strong> ensuring near-unity power factor and reduced reactive load.</li>
<li><strong>Segment controller</strong> enabling selective activation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The vehicle’s secondary circuit rectifies the induced AC and regulates DC output via a buck converter. Feedback control maintains constant DC bus voltage despite coupling variations as the vehicle moves.</p>
<p>To achieve soft switching and minimize inverter loss, KAIST implemented <strong>zero-voltage switching (ZVS)</strong>. The design principles mirror those outlined by Li and Mi [1], where LCL networks operate as current sources at resonance, stabilizing transfer under misalignment.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-vi-performance-analysis-"><strong>VI. Performance Analysis</strong></h2>
<h3 id="-a-efficiency-"><strong>A. Efficiency</strong></h3>
<p>Measured overall efficiencies range from <strong>70–83 %</strong>, depending on vehicle type and alignment. While lower than stationary pad systems (which exceed 90 %), these figures are sufficient for continuous charging at transit speeds (≤60 km/h).</p>
<p>Li and Mi’s comparative data show that earlier stationary prototypes—such as the University of Auckland’s 5 kW DD pad—achieved 90 % efficiency over 200 mm gaps, validating OLEV’s performance within theoretical limits for dynamic systems.</p>
<h3 id="-b-energy-supply-and-range-"><strong>B. Energy Supply and Range</strong></h3>
<p>With 60 kW delivered intermittently, a bus can maintain battery charge indefinitely while in motion. Consequently, the onboard battery capacity can be reduced to <strong>20 %</strong> of that required in plug-in EVs, cutting weight and cost substantially.</p>
<p>Simulation studies cited by Li and Mi [1] suggest that <strong>electrifying just 1 % of urban roads</strong> could enable 300-mile range operation for most vehicles, a transformative reduction in battery dependency.</p>
<h3 id="-c-cost-and-infrastructure-"><strong>C. Cost and Infrastructure</strong></h3>
<p>The infrastructure cost is approximately <strong>USD 0.4 million per kilometer</strong> for a one-way road including converters and coils. This figure is small compared with full roadway construction costs. The reduction in vehicle battery size offsets infrastructure expenses, yielding net economic advantage in high-traffic corridors such as bus routes or urban logistics lanes.</p>
<h3 id="-d-safety-and-compliance-"><strong>D. Safety and Compliance</strong></h3>
<p>Safety is a primary concern due to magnetic field exposure. Measurements in OLEV systems recorded field strengths below <strong>5 μT at 1 m height</strong>, meeting the <strong>ICNIRP 2010</strong> public limit of 27 μT.
Shielding by the vehicle chassis and segmental activation further reduces stray emissions. The project aligns with forthcoming <strong>SAE J2954</strong> and <strong>IEEE C95.1-2005</strong> guidelines discussed by Li and Mi.</p>
<h3 id="-e-reliability-"><strong>E. Reliability</strong></h3>
<p>Dynamic WPT eliminates mechanical connectors, reducing maintenance and improving system uptime under outdoor conditions. Segmented activation mitigates heating and electromagnetic interference between adjacent tracks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-vii-comparative-discussion-"><strong>VII. Comparative Discussion</strong></h2>
<p>The OLEV project demonstrates large-scale viability but differs from other efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL)</strong>: 3–8 kW stationary prototypes achieving 90 % efficiency for passenger EVs.</li>
<li><strong>University of Michigan–Dearborn</strong>: 8 kW system achieving 95.7 % DC-to-DC efficiency at 200 mm separation [1].</li>
</ul>
<p>While these stationary systems deliver higher efficiency, they cannot provide unlimited range. OLEV’s dynamic approach trades some efficiency for continuous operation and battery downsizing—an advantageous compromise for mass transit networks.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-viii-broader-impact-"><strong>VIII. Broader Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Dynamic WPT such as OLEV enables:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reduced Battery Dependence:</strong> Smaller batteries lower cost, extend lifespan, and reduce resource demand.</li>
<li><strong>Grid Integration:</strong> With bidirectional converters, vehicles could feed power back, supporting grid balancing (V2G).</li>
<li><strong>Urban Clean Transport:</strong> Zero tailpipe emissions with minimal infrastructure footprint.</li>
</ol>
<p>Li and Mi emphasize that wireless charging “could set humans free from the annoying wires,” and OLEV exemplifies that vision at system scale.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-ix-future-outlook-"><strong>IX. Future Outlook</strong></h2>
<p>Research directions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing coupling efficiency under misalignment through adaptive resonant control.</li>
<li>Standardizing pad geometry and frequency bands (20–85 kHz) for interoperability.</li>
<li>Integrating renewable generation and vehicle-to-grid communication via DSRC or 5G-V2X links.</li>
<li>Cost reduction using ferrite-free composite materials.</li>
</ul>
<p>As semiconductor switching devices (SiC, GaN) mature, inverter frequency and efficiency will rise, improving power density for next-generation dynamic WPT.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="-x-conclusion-"><strong>X. Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>The KAIST OLEV project demonstrates that dynamic wireless power transfer for EVs is technically feasible, safe, and economically justified in high-duty applications. With coupling coefficients of 0.15–0.25 and efficiency up to 83 %, the system maintains vehicle charge during operation and drastically reduces battery capacity needs.</p>
<p>Drawing on Li and Mi’s comprehensive review, OLEV validates that inductive WPT can evolve from laboratory theory to operational infrastructure. Continued optimization and global standardization will determine its role in future electric mobility ecosystems.</p>
